## Overview
---
- This is my third of Milestone Project 3 which is part of the Code Isntitute's FullStack Software Development Diploma Course and the main requirements is to build a full-stack website allowing users to manage a common dataset.
This project demonstrates the skills and knowledge of using the HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Python, Flask and MongoDB in Back-End development which I have learned recently on the course.
- This is a Smoothie Lovers page, which was designed for all people who love smoothies and would like to find and share their own recipes with others. This page can also be used as a storage for users recipes collection and allow users to freely share their recipes with each other and to have handy to see the recipes anytime they need it. 
- The aim of the project is to create a cookbook wepsite with smoothies recipes which will be divided into 4 different categories to choose from. Upon registration, the user will receive their own accounts and will be able to save, modify and store their own recipes as well as share them with other registered users. 
The website is created in a responsive design that is very handy to see recipes from mobile devices to tablets or larger screens.
- The website was created for educational purposes.
